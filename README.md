# Trying to understand DSA and Problem Solving

personal notes:

What ?
Given a problem/case and the answer in code.

Why ? 
help to make a strong understanding of software engineering, because in CP we learn to solve problem. 
Actually, its not just to solve, able to identifying the problem is half of the solution.
problem solving also very useful in life.

How ?
- English
- Math
    - Algebra
    - Combinatorics
    - Modular Arithmetic
    - Number Theory
    - Graph Theory(Advanced)
- Practice everyday
    seems cliche, but its true. 
    to better at something, must invest time.
    deep understand and solve many problem → faster to recognize new problem.
    HackerRank and LeetCode for now is enough.
    

Common Mistake
1. Depend on courses.
2. Reading too much → reading is good but we need active, instead too much of passive learning.
3. Using advanced technique for simple problem -> Simpler technique = better Algorithm
